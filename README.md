# Dual Pincer Plugin

> **An OpenCode plugin that runs two independent AI agents in parallel to debate any plan or prompt from opposite directions, then reconciles their analyses into a stronger result.**

## How It Works

Dual Pincer applies a structured debate workflow to any prompt:

```
User Prompt  ──▶  Mediator Drafts Plan
                       │
              ┌────────┴────────┐
              ▼                 ▼
         Steelman           Red Team
       (defends it)       (attacks it)
              │                 │
              └────────┬────────┘
                       ▼
              Mediator finds the CRUX
                       │
                       ▼
              Revised, stronger result
```

1. **Draft** — The mediator agent analyzes your request and produces a draft plan/response
2. **Debate** — Two independent agents review the draft simultaneously:
   - **Steelman (Pincer A)** — Argues why the draft is RIGHT (strongest defense)
   - **Red Team (Pincer B)** — Argues why the draft is WRONG (strongest attack)
3. **Crux** — The mediator finds the single key point of disagreement between the two analyses
4. **Revise** — The mediator produces a final response that addresses the crux

The result is a better answer than either agent alone could produce.

## Installation

Read [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) for full installation instructions (npm, GitHub, or local checkout).

---

## Usage

### Via CLI command

```
/dual-pincer <your prompt>
```

### Via mediator agent directly

Run the `dual-pincer-mediator` agent from OpenCode's agent picker.

### Via `dp_analyze` tool

Any agent that has the `dp_analyze` tool enabled can call it:

```
Use dp_analyze with this draft: ...
```

### Example

```
/dual-pincer Should we migrate from REST to GraphQL?
```

The mediator will:
1. Draft a migration plan
2. Have Steelman argue FOR and Red Team argue AGAINST
3. Find the crux of the disagreement
4. Give you a revised, stronger recommendation

---

## What's the Crux?

The **crux** is the single assumption or claim where Steelman says "looks fine" and Red Team says "this is broken." Most debate happens at the edges — the crux is where they collide head-on. By identifying it, you get a targeted insight that no single agent would surface on its own.

## Agents & Commands

This plugin registers three agents and one command:

| Name | Mode | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `dual-pincer-mediator` | `primary` | Orchestrates the full workflow (draft → analyze → crux → revise) |
| `dual-pincer-steelman` | `subagent` | Pincer A — builds the strongest defense of the draft |
| `dual-pincer-redteam` | `subagent` | Pincer B — attacks the draft ruthlessly |
| `/dual-pincer` | command | CLI shortcut to invoke the mediator |

See [`agents.md`](agents.md) for detailed documentation.
